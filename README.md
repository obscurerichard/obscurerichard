- 👋 Hi, I’m @obscurerichard
- 👀 I’m interested in software architecture, DevOps, distributed systems, Linux, Kubernetes, Docker and maintaining software systems over the long term.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Kubernetes on small systems (think Raspberry Pi)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting my [non-profit, obscure.org](https://www.obscure.org/) migrated to a newer set of systems
- 📫 You can reach me at [rbulling@obscure.org](mailto:rbulling@obscure.org] and other ways listed on my [home page](https://www.obscure.org/~rbulling/)
